      "An Internship is a part of student’s academic session which involves student’s participation in any industry either manufacturing or service industry. The internship program helps students to gain practical knowledge apart from the theoretical concept which they have studied in their curriculum. Being an internee, students are exposed to the real scenario of the market where they understand the difference between the theoretical and practical concept. Here, the internee can broaden their experience and learn something extra than the theoretical concept. Students have good opportunity to be hired by the enterprises if they perform well during their internship period.\n",

Starting from November 2021 I was searching a construction company by myself. I was also comparing different construction companies and projects. Finally, I decide to take my internship program in Sworup Construction and Suppliers Pvt. Ltd. But the agency has only site at Dhapasi & Sindhupalchowk which was constructed by Sworup Construction and Suppliers Pvt. Ltd. When we went to this site to start our internship program, the construction of the private building was rigorously going to finish the project in the allocated time. Since, the agency has only one site at Kathmandu, the Engineers of the company made contact with concerned bodies and they let me to take my internship program in this company in its Management department.

      "Engineering companies have acquired considerable importance in modern economies, even extending into technological areas of construction. They can serve as a one-stop consultancy offering all of the services necessary for definition/production and thereby assume overall responsibility for these operations. The task of engineering companies is to respond to a requirement and take it to project level. Engineering companies design, study and bring about, in whole or in part, works, equipment or industrial products. They play the part of messenger between the theoretical knowledge developed by scientists and its practical applications: using this new knowledge, they make a client’s project feasible, then real. For example, their mission could consist in designing a motorway, hospital, factory, bridge or dam (design, calculations and detailed drawings), then supervising its construction by contractors. It may also involve designing a product, for example a vehicle lighting system for a car manufacturer, a section of the Airbus A380, or tram equipment. Engineering consultancy companies design these projects and look after the objectives of their clients during construction and manufacture by specialist companies. Sometimes the word “engineering” is used for one part only of these services or works.\n",

It is a question of managing the project in order to lead it to completion within the restraints of cost, delivery times and quality and therefore manage the risks. This assumes: choosing and organizing all the numerous musicians, that is to say the various participants in the project; ensuring harmony between all the “instruments”, that is to say ensuring cohesion between the various participants in building the work; n directing the “orchestra”, that is to say directing the satisfactory progress of the project; giving the “rhythm” to this musical ensemble, that is to say ensuring the completion of the project at a sustained rate.\n",
